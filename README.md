## About

This is the development version of the next generation of this OS. I'm planning to completely rewrite [the previous version](https://github.com/Twometer/nekosys/tree/1.x) with improved stability, better code and more features. Please note however, that this is not intended as a research project into the future of operating systems, but rather just a fun coding and learning project of mine :3
