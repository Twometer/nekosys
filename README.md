  nekosys is an x86 operating system written from scratch in modern C++

## About

This is the **development version** of the next generation of this OS. I'm planning to completely rewrite [the previous version](https://github.com/Twometer/nekosys/tree/1.x) with improved stability, better code and more features.

Please note that this is not a research project into the future of operating systems, but rather just a project of mine I am having fun working an. Therefore I might not always implement the best way of doing something :3

-   Netwide Assembler (nasm)
