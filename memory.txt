Currently used physical memory map:

[0x7C00 + 200h]: Boot sector / Stage 1 Bootloader
[0x7E00 + 400h]: Stage 2 bootloader
[0x8000 + 200h]: Stores the memory map after Stage 2 bootloader is gone
[0x8200 + 400h]: Placeholder for some FAT sectors
[0xA000 + ...h]: Stores the kernel. Maximum length is 0x75FFF (471K, low memory end)


Currently used virtual memory map:
none, lol
